When learning something new, like software development, it is important to create a habit.  Repetition is your friend.  This is something that I have struggled with throughout the program and it is my goal to improve that.  There are days in my life that are especially hectic and I will end up taking a few days off and then craming everything into one day.  The issue with this is that I find myself having to reacclimate myself and retouch my last few lessons.

Going forward, I am going to try something new.  My idea is to complete at least one lesson a day.  On the days that I have time, I will make up lessons, but on the busy days, I will complete at least one.  I think this habit will both keep my momentum going and prevent me from having to take a step back on my "cram" days.

My next blog post will cover how this new habit is panning out!
