I was very excited to start the Sinatra project and embark on the journey to creating a functioning website.  I knew it would be challenging, but I was ready to test my coding skills.  When I began, I found myself staying up until 4am, spending entirely too much time on CSS and JS making my project "pretty".  For the most part, everything went very smooth and the learn instruct videos proved to be a valuable resource.  I did however learn one lesson that I will aim to remember for future projects.

I learned the importance of making very small changes, committing(Git) those changers, and testing those changes.  I noticed that when everything was going well, I would get into a "flow state" and just continue to code.  For the most part, everthing worked out... until it didn't.  I quickly learned that by making large commits, I made it very hard to isolate an error.  Everything that we do tends to be interdependent and one thing may not work because of something way down the chain.

I found testing these small changes to be more important than making the changes small.  If I didn't test my changes it could be very difficult to find my issue.  Many times, I would make small changes, but change that part multiple times.  So for example, I may change 3 different lines of code, 3 times each, and now have 9 commits.  That is great, but now I can have 9 different iterations of my commits and no idea which one works!
