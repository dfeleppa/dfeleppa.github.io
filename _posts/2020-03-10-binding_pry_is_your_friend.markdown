When you're first exposed to software development, it can easily be one of the most overwhelming endeavors.  I found that I was being introduced to an endless amount of "things" and trying to guess as to what they were and how they worked together.  For example, you are quickly introduced to the IDE, text editors, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, ruby, VS Code, atom, classes, variables, instances, iterators... the list goes on.  It was a challenge to try and balance absorbing all of this new information with progressing at a reasonable pace.  I often found myself finishing a lab, not quite fully understanding the concept, and wondering if I should take the extra time to dig deeper or move forward.

A perfect example of this was the "pry" gem and utilizing binding.pry.  When we first started using it, it seemed like a waste of time because we knew the expected result.  Then when it was suggested to be used in later labs, it seemed to complicated to learn, and the time spent researching "pry" could be used on other labs.  Then the came the CLI Data Gem Portfolio Project Gem...

When  started the CLI Data Project Gem, I had no idea was an API was, nor how to parse one.  So I did my research, found an API, and began my project.  I wrote my whole project with "dummy code" that would later be replaced with data that I would pull from my API.  Then it came time to parse my data... hours later... little progress made.  Then I realized that API's could be documents and that made parsing them much easier.  I considered giving up, but then I gave "pry" a shot and it was a life saver.  First, "pry" enabled my to navigate the data and find the "keys" and "values" I needed.  Perhaps more importantly, testing different snippets of code actually helped me learned how rub functions!  Reading and working on labs are great, but when you're building your own Ruby gem and "pry'ing" your way through data, you gain a deeper understanding of how objects interact with one another.

I will definitely be using "pry" from now on!
