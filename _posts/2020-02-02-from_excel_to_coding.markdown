Change can be difficult and change can be frightening.  When making a major life change, it is natural to seek the "right time".  While these decisions should not be taken lightly, we can never be certain if we are making the right decision.  If I could offer any advice to someone considering making a life-altering decision, it would be to remember the outcome of not making a change is just as much of a risk as making the change.

At the age of 32, I have spent 8 years in the financial services industry, and most of my experience is centered around sales.  Sales is far from a passion and I find very little fulfillment in my job.  My position is however, relatively secure and pays well.  Nonetheless, I constantly found myself focusing my efforts on the technical aspects of my job, often spending too much time on tasks that would not necessarily increase my sales revenue.  I would build out SalesForce reports and dashboards, improving the production of every sales representative on my team.  I would create complex Excel spreadsheets to track sales revenue, payouts, and potential opportunities, taking pride in how complex the "code" in my spreadsheets could get.  It wasn't long before a coworker asked why I was in my current position, as opposed to a career in technology.

When I was asked why I was in a sales role and not a tech role, I initially thought of sales support roles and how that wouldn't interest me.  Then I thought back to my childhood... In 6th grade, I distinctly remember being 100% certain that I wanted a career in "computers".  By 8th grade, I was building my own computers, and getting deeper into tech.  In 9th grade, I took a computer programming class, where we learn Visual Basic and I loved it.  However, at some point in high school, this passion seemed to dissipate.  I had this notion that the tech field was exploding, everyone would seek a career in tech, and there would be too much competition for a job.  Could I be more wrong?

After connecting my coworker's suggestion with my childhood passion, I realized I should give this comment more thought.  I began researching careers in tech, listening to coding podcasts, and became cognisant of how attracted to problem solving I was.  The more I compared a career in software engineering to sales, the closer I came to my decision, and now here I am.
